# Out-of-the-box Vector Store connectors (Preview)

> [!WARNING]
> The Semantic Kernel Vector Store functionality is in preview, and improvements that require breaking changes may still occur in limited circumstances before release.

Semantic Kernel provides a number of out-of-the-box Vector Store integrations making it easy to get started with using Vector Stores. It also allows you to experiment with a free or locally hosted Vector Store and then easily switch to a service when scale requires it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some connectors are using SDKs that are not officially supported by Microsoft or by the Database provider. The *Officially supported SDK* column lists which are using officially supported SDKs and which are not.
