## Overview

The Volatile Vector Store connector is a Vector Store implementation provided by Semantic Kernel that uses no external database and stores data in memory.
This Vector Store is useful for prototyping scenarios or where high-speed in-memory operations are required.

The connector has the following characteristics.

| Feature Area                      | Support                                                                                                                          |

| StoragePropertyName supported?    | No, since storage is volatile and data reuse is therefore not possible, custom naming is not useful and not supported.           |

## Getting started

Add the Semantic Kernel Core nuget package to your project.

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Core
```

You can add the vector store to the dependency injection container available on the `KernelBuilder` or to the `IServiceCollection` dependency injection container using extension methods provided by Semantic Kernel.

```csharp
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;

// Using Kernel Builder.
var kernelBuilder = Kernel
    .CreateBuilder()
    .AddVolatileVectorStore();
```

```csharp
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;

// Using IServiceCollection with ASP.NET Core.
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddVolatileVectorStore();
```

You can construct a Volatile Vector Store instance directly.

```csharp
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Data;

var vectorStore = new VolatileVectorStore();
```

It is possible to construct a direct reference to a named collection.

```csharp
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Data;

var collection = new VolatileVectorStoreRecordCollection<string, Hotel>("skhotels");
```

## Getting started

Install semantic kernel.

```cli
pip install semantic-kernel
```

You can then create a vector store instance using the `VolatileStore` class.

```python

from semantic_kernel.connectors.memory.volatile import VolatileStore

vector_store = VolatileStore()
```

You can also create a collection directly.

```python
from semantic_kernel.connectors.memory.volatile import VolatileCollection

collection = VolatileCollection(collection_name="skhotels", data_model_type=Hotel)
```

## Serialization

Since the Volatile connector has a simple dict as the internal storage mechanism it can store any data model that can be serialized to a dict.

For more details on this concept see the [serialization documentation](./../serialization.md).

## Getting started

Include the latest version of the Semantic Kernel API in your Maven project, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.semantic-kernel</groupId>
    <artifactId>semantickernel-api</artifactId>
    <version>[LATEST]</version>
</dependency>
```

You can then create a vector store instance using the `VolatileVectorStore` class.

```java
import com.microsoft.semantickernel.data.VolatileVectorStore;
import com.microsoft.semantickernel.data.VolatileVectorStoreRecordCollection;
import com.microsoft.semantickernel.data.VolatileVectorStoreRecordCollectionOptions;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build an Azure AI Search Vector Store
        var vectorStore = new VolatileVectorStore();
    }
}
```
You can also create a collection directly.

```java
var collection = new VolatileVectorStoreRecordCollection<>("skhotels",
        VolatileVectorStoreRecordCollectionOptions.<Hotel>builder()
                .withRecordClass(Hotel.class)
                .build());
```
