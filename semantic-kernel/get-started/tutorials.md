        This project contains a collection of .NET examples for various scenarios using Semantic Kernel components. There are already 40 examples that show how to achieve basic tasks like creating a chain, adding a plugin, and running a chain. There are also more advanced examples that show how to use the Semantic Kernel API to create a custom plugin, stream data, and more.
