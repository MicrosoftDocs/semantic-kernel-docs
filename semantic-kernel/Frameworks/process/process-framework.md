# Overview of the Process Framework

Welcome to the Process Framework within Microsoft's Semantic Kernel—a cutting-edge approach designed to optimize AI integration with your business processes. This framework empowers developers to efficiently create, manage, and deploy business processes while leveraging the powerful capabilities of AI, alongside your existing code and systems.

A Process is a structured sequence of activities or tasks that deliver a service or product, adding value in alignment with specific business goals for customers.

> [!NOTE]
> Process Framework package is currently experimental and is subject to change until it is moved to preview and GA.
    
## Introduction to the Process Framework

The Process Framework provides a robust solution for automating complex workflows. Each step within the framework performs tasks by invoking user-defined Kernel Functions, utilizing an event-driven model to manage workflow execution.

By embedding AI into your business processes, you can significantly enhance productivity and decision-making capabilities. With the Process Framework, you benefit from seamless AI integration, facilitating smarter and more responsive workflows. This framework streamlines operations, fosters improved collaboration between business units, and boosts overall efficiency.


## Key Features

- **Leverage Semantic Kernel:** Steps can utilize one or multiple Kernel Functions, enabling you to tap into all aspects of Semantic Kernel within your processes.
- **Reusability & Flexibility:** Steps and processes can be reused across different applications, promoting modularity and scalability.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Utilize events and metadata to trigger actions and transitions between process steps effectively.
- **Full Control and Auditability:** Maintain control of processes in a defined and repeatable manner, complete with audit capabilities through Open Telemetry.


## Core Concepts

- **Process:** A collection of steps arranged to achieve a specific business goal for customers.
- **Step:** An activity within a process that has defined inputs and outputs, contributing to a larger goal.
- **Pattern:** The specific sequence type that dictates how steps are executed for the process to be fully completed.


## Business Process Examples

Business processes are a part of our daily routines. Here are three examples you might have encountered this week:

1. **Account Opening:** This process includes multiple steps such as credit pulls and ratings, fraud detection, creating customer accounts in core systems, and sending welcome information to the customer, including their customer ID.
2. **Food Delivery:** Ordering food for delivery is a familiar process. From receiving the order via phone, website, or app, to preparing each food item, ensuring quality control, driver assignment, and final delivery, there are many steps in this process that can be streamlined.
3. **Support Ticket:** We have all submitted support tickets—whether for new services, IT support, or other needs. This process can involve multiple subprocesses based on business and customer requirements, ultimately aiming for satisfaction by addressing customer needs effectively.
