# How-To: Using Cycles

> [!WARNING]
> The _Semantic Kernel Process Framework_ is experimental, still in development and is subject to change.

## Overview

In the previous section we built a simple Process to help us automate the creation of documentation for our new product. In this section we will improve on that process by adding a proofreading step. This step will use and LLM to grade the generated documentation as Pass/Fail, and provide recommended changes if needed. By taking advantage of the Process Frameworks' support for cycles, we can go one step further and automatically apply the recommended changes (if any) and then start the cycle over, repeating this until the content meets our quality bar. The updated process will look like this:

![Flow diagram for our process with a cycle for author-critic pattern.](../../../media/process-cycle-flow.png)

## Updates to the process

We need to create our new proofreader step and also make a couple changes to our document generation step that will allow us to apply suggestions if needed.

### Add the proofreader step

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

```csharp
// A process step to proofread documentation
public class ProofreadStep : KernelProcessStep
{
    [KernelFunction]
    public async Task ProofreadDocumentationAsync(Kernel kernel, KernelProcessStepContext context, string documentation)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{nameof(ProofreadDocumentationAsync)}:\n\tProofreading documentation...");

        var systemPrompt =
            """

        for a product and you must do the following things:

        1. Determine if the documentation is passes the following criteria:
            1. Documentation must use a professional tone.
            1. Documentation should be free of spelling or grammar mistakes.
            1. Documentation should be free of any offensive or inappropriate language.
            1. Documentation should be technically accurate.
        2. If the documentation does not pass 1, you must write detailed feedback of the changes that are needed to improve the documentation. 
        """;

        ChatHistory chatHistory = new ChatHistory(systemPrompt);
        chatHistory.AddUserMessage(documentation);

        // Use structured output to ensure the response format is easily parsable
        OpenAIPromptExecutionSettings settings = new OpenAIPromptExecutionSettings();
        settings.ResponseFormat = typeof(ProofreadingResponse);

        IChatCompletionService chatCompletionService = kernel.GetRequiredService<IChatCompletionService>();
        var proofreadResponse = await chatCompletionService.GetChatMessageContentAsync(chatHistory, executionSettings: settings);
        var formattedResponse = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<ProofreadingResponse>(proofreadResponse.Content!.ToString());

        Console.WriteLine($"\n\tGrade: {(formattedResponse!.MeetsExpectations ? "Pass" : "Fail")}\n\tExplanation: {formattedResponse.Explanation}\n\tSuggestions: {string.Join("\n\t\t", formattedResponse.Suggestions)}");

        if (formattedResponse.MeetsExpectations)
        {
            await context.EmitEventAsync("DocumentationApproved", data: documentation);
        }
        else
        {
            await context.EmitEventAsync("DocumentationRejected", data: new { Explanation = formattedResponse.Explanation, Suggestions = formattedResponse.Suggestions});
        }
    }

    // A class 
    private class ProofreadingResponse
    {
        [Description("Specifies if the proposed documentation meets the expected standards for publishing.")]
        public bool MeetsExpectations { get; set; }

        [Description("An explanation of why the documentation does or does not meet expectations.")]
        public string Explanation { get; set; } = "";

        [Description("A lis of suggestions, may be empty if there no suggestions for improvement.")]
        public List<string> Suggestions { get; set; } = new();
    }
}
```

A new step named `ProofreadStep` has been created. This step uses the LLM to grade the generated documentation as discussed above. Notice that this step conditionally emits either the `DocumentationApproved` event or the `DocumentationRejected` event based on the response from the LLM. In the case of `DocumentationApproved`, the event will include the approved documentation as it's payload and in the case of `DocumentationRejected` it will include the suggestions from the proofreader.

### Flow updates

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

```csharp
// Create the process builder
ProcessBuilder processBuilder = new("DocumentationGeneration");

// Add the steps
var infoGatheringStep = processBuilder.AddStepFromType<GatherProductInfoStep>();
var docsGenerationStep = processBuilder.AddStepFromType<GenerateDocumentationStepV2>();
var docsProofreadStep = processBuilder.AddStepFromType<ProofreadStep>(); // Add new step here
var docsPublishStep = processBuilder.AddStepFromType<PublishDocumentationStep>();

// Orchestrate the events
processBuilder
    .OnInputEvent("Start")
    .SendEventTo(new(infoGatheringStep));

infoGatheringStep
    .OnFunctionResult()
    .SendEventTo(new(docsGenerationStep, functionName: "GenerateDocumentation"));

docsGenerationStep
    .OnEvent("DocumentationGenerated")
    .SendEventTo(new(docsProofreadStep));

docsProofreadStep
    .OnEvent("DocumentationApproved")
    .SendEventTo(new(docsPublishStep));

var process = processBuilder.Build();
return process;
```

Our updated process routing now does the following:
- When an external event with `id = Start` is sent to the process, this event and its associated data will be sent to the `infoGatheringStep`.
- When the `infoGatheringStep` finishes running, send the returned object to the `docsGenerationStep`.
- When the `docsGenerationStep` finishes running, send the generated docs to the `docsProofreadStep`.
- When the `docsProofreadStep` rejects our documentation and provides suggestions, send the suggestions back to the `docsGenerationStep`.
- Finally, when the `docsProofreadStep` approves our documentation, send the returned object to the `docsPublishStep`.

                Remove informal phrases such as 'who knew coffee could be so... illuminating?'
                Consider editing out overly whimsical phrases like 'it's like a warm hug for your nose!' for a more straightforward description.

                Consider simplifying sentences such as 'Meet your new personal barista!' to be more straightforward, for example, 'Introducing your personal barista.'

## What's Next?

Our process is now reliably generating documentation that meets our defined standards. This is great, but before we publish our documentation publicly we really should require a human to review and approve. Let's do that next.
