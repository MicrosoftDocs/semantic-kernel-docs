## What is _Agent Chat_?

_Agent Chat_ provides a framework that enables interaction between multiple agents, even if they are of different types. This makes it possible for a [_Chat Completion Agent_](./chat-completion-agent.md) and an [_Open AI Assistant Agent_](./assistant-agent.md) to work together within the same conversation. _Agent Chat_ also defines entry points for initiating collaboration between agents, whether through multiple responses or a single agent response.

As an abstract class, _Agent Chat_ can be subclassed to support custom scenarios.

One such subclass, _Agent Group Chat_, offers a concrete implementation of _Agent Chat_, using a strategy-based approach to manage conversation dynamics.


## Creating an _Agent Group Chat_

To create an _Agent Group Chat_, you may either specify the participating agents or create an empty chat and subsequently add agent participants.  Configuring the _Chat-Settings_ and _Strategies_ is also performed during _Agent Group Chat_ initialization. These settings define how the conversation dynamics will function within the group.

> Note: The default _Chat-Settings_ result in a conversation that is limited to a single response.  See [_Agent Chat_ Behavior](#defining-agent-group-chat-behavior) for details on configuring _Chat-Settings.

#### Creating _Agent Group Chat_ with _Agents_:

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
```csharp
// Define agents
ChatCompletionAgent agent1 = ...;
OpenAIAssistantAgent agent2 = ...;

// Create chat with participating agents.
AgentGroupChat chat = new(agent1, agent2);
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
```python
# Define agents
agent1 = ChatCompletionAgent(...)
agent2 = OpenAIAssistantAgent(...)

# Create chat with participating agents
chat = AgentGroupChat(agents=[agent1, agent2])
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

> Agents are currently unavailable in Java.

::: zone-end

#### Adding _Agents_ to a _Agent Group Chat_:

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
```csharp
// Define agents
ChatCompletionAgent agent1 = ...;
OpenAIAssistantAgent agent2 = ...;

// Create an empty chat.
AgentGroupChat chat = new();

// Add agents to an existing chat.
chat.AddAgent(agent1);
chat.AddAgent(agent2);
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
```python
# Define agents
agent1 = ChatCompletionAgent(...)
agent2 = OpenAIAssistantAgent(...)

# Create an empty chat
chat = AgentGroupChat()

# Add agents to an existing chat
chat.add_agent(agent=agent1)
chat.add_agent(agent=agent2)
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

> Agents are currently unavailable in Java.

::: zone-end


## Using _Agent Group Chat_

_Agent Chat_ supports two modes of operation: _Single-Turn_ and _Multi-Turn_.  In _single-turn_, a specific agent is designated to provide a response. In _multi-turn_, all agents in the conversation take turns responding until a termination criterion is met. In both modes, agents can collaborate by responding to one another to achieve a defined goal.

### Providing Input

Adding an input message to an _Agent Chat_ follows the same pattern as whit a _Chat History_ object.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
```csharp
AgentGroupChat chat = new();

chat.AddChatMessage(new ChatMessageContent(AuthorRole.User, "<message content>"));
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
```python
chat = AgentGroupChat()

await chat.add_chat_message(ChatMessageContent(role=AuthorRole.USER, content="<message content>"))
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

> Agents are currently unavailable in Java.

::: zone-end

### Single-Turn Agent Invocation

In a multi-turn invocation, the system must decide which agent responds next and when the conversation should end. In contrast, a single-turn invocation simply returns a response from the specified agent, allowing the caller to directly manage agent participation.

After an agent participates in the _Agent Chat_ through a single-turn invocation, it is added to the set of _agents_ eligible for multi-turn invocation.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
```csharp
// Define an agent
ChatCompletionAgent agent = ...;

// Create an empty chat.
AgentGroupChat chat = new();

// Invoke an agent for its response
ChatMessageContent[] messages = await chat.InvokeAsync(agent).ToArrayAsync();
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
```python
# Define an agent
agent = ChatCompletionAgent(...)

# Create an empty chat
chat = AgentGroupChat()

# Invoke an agent for its response(s)
async for message in chat.invoke(agent)
    # process message response(s)
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

> Agents are currently unavailable in Java.

::: zone-end

### Multi-Turn Agent Invocation

While agent collaboration requires that a system must be in place that not only determines which agent should respond during each turn but also assesses when the conversation has achieved its intended goal, initiating multi-turn collaboration remains straightforward.

Agent responses are returned asynchronously as they are generated, allowing the conversation to unfold in real-time.

> Note: In following sections, [Agent Selection](#agent-selection) and [Chat Termination](#chat-termination), will delve into the _Execution Settings_ in detail.  The default _Execution Settings_ employs sequential or round-robin selection and limits agent participation to a single turn.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

.NET _Execution Settings_ API: [`AgentGroupChatSettings`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.agents.chat.agentgroupchatsettings)

```csharp
// Define agents
ChatCompletionAgent agent1 = ...;
OpenAIAssistantAgent agent2 = ...;

// Create chat with participating agents.
AgentGroupChat chat =
  new(agent1, agent2)
  {
    // Override default execution settings
    ExecutionSettings =
    {
        TerminationStrategy = { MaximumIterations = 10 }
    }
  };

// Invoke agents
await foreach (ChatMessageContent response in chat.InvokeAsync())
{
  // Process agent response(s)...
}
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
```python
# Define agents
agent1 = ChatCompletionAgent(...)
agent2 = OpenAIAssistantAgent(...)

# Create chat with participating agents
chat = AgentGroupChat(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    termination_strategy=DefaultTerminationStrategy(maximum_iterations=10),
)

async for response in chat.invoke():
    # process agent response(s)
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

> Agents are currently unavailable in Java.

::: zone-end

### Accessing Chat History

The _Agent Chat_ conversation history is always accessible, even though messages are delivered through the invocation pattern. This ensures that past exchanges remain available throughout the conversation.

> Note: The most recent message is provided first (descending order: newest to oldest).

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
```csharp
// Define and use a chat
AgentGroupChat chat = ...;

// Access history for a previously utilized AgentGroupChat
ChatMessageContent[] history = await chat.GetChatMessagesAsync().ToArrayAsync();
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
```python
# Define a group chat
chat = AgentGroupChat(...)

# Access history for a previously utilized AgentGroupChat
history = await chat.get_chat_messages()
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

> Agents are currently unavailable in Java.

::: zone-end

Since different agent types or configurations may maintain their own version of the conversation history, agent specific history is also available by specifing an agent.  (For example: [_Open AI Assistant_](./assistant-agent.md) versus [_Chat Completion Agent_](./chat-completion-agent.md).)

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
```csharp
// Agents to participate in chat
ChatCompletionAgent agent1 = ...;
OpenAIAssistantAgent agent2 = ...;

// Define a group chat
AgentGroupChat chat = ...;

// Access history for a previously utilized AgentGroupChat
ChatMessageContent[] history1 = await chat.GetChatMessagesAsync(agent1).ToArrayAsync();
ChatMessageContent[] history2 = await chat.GetChatMessagesAsync(agent2).ToArrayAsync();
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
```python
# Agents to participate in a chat
agent1 = ChatCompletionAgent(...)
agent2 = OpenAIAssistantAgent(...)

# Define a group chat
chat = AgentGroupChat(...)

# Access history for a previously utilized AgentGroupChat
history1 = await chat.get_chat_messages(agent=agent1)
history2 = await chat.get_chat_messages(agent=agent2)
```

## Defining _Agent Group Chat_ Behavior

Collaboration among agents to solve complex tasks is a core agentic pattern. To use this pattern effectively, a system must be in place that not only determines which agent should respond during each turn but also assesses when the conversation has achieved its intended goal. This requires managing agent selection and establishing clear criteria for conversation termination, ensuring seamless cooperation between agents toward a solution. Both of these aspects are governed by the _Execution Settings_ property.

The following sections, [Agent Selection](#agent-selection) and [Chat Termination](#chat-termination), will delve into these considerations in detail.

### Agent Selection

In multi-turn invocation, agent selection is guided by a _Selection Strategy_. This strategy is defined by a base class that can be extended to implement custom behaviors tailored to specific needs. For convenience, two predefined concrete _Selection Strategies_ are also available, offering ready-to-use approaches for handling agent selection during conversations.

If known, an initial agent may be specified to always take the first turn.  A history reducer may also be employed to limit token usage when using a strategy based on a _Kernel Function_.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

.NET Selection Strategy API:
- [`SelectionStrategy`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.agents.chat.selectionstrategy)
- [`SequentialSelectionStrategy`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.agents.chat.sequentialselectionstrategy)
- [`KernelFunctionSelectionStrategy`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.agents.chat.kernelfunctionselectionstrategy)
- [`Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Agents.History`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.agents.history)

```csharp
// Define the agent names for use in the function template
const string WriterName = "Writer";
const string ReviewerName = "Reviewer";

// Initialize a Kernel with a chat-completion service
Kernel kernel = ...;

// Create the agents
ChatCompletionAgent writerAgent =
    new()
    {
        Name = WriterName,
        Instructions = "<writer instructions>",
        Kernel = kernel
    };

ChatCompletionAgent reviewerAgent =
    new()
    {
        Name = ReviewerName,
        Instructions = "<reviewer instructions>",
        Kernel = kernel
    };

// Define a kernel function for the selection strategy
KernelFunction selectionFunction =
    AgentGroupChat.CreatePromptFunctionForStrategy(

        Choose only from these participants:
        - {{{ReviewerName}}}
        - {{{WriterName}}}
        
        Always follow these rules when selecting the next participant:
        - After {{{WriterName}}}, it is {{{ReviewerName}}}'s turn.
        - After {{{ReviewerName}}}, it is {{{WriterName}}}'s turn.

        History:
        {{$history}}
        """,
        safeParameterNames: "history");

// Define the selection strategy
KernelFunctionSelectionStrategy selectionStrategy = 
  new(selectionFunction, kernel)
  {
      // Always start with the writer agent.
      InitialAgent = writerAgent,
      // Parse the function response.
      ResultParser = (result) => result.GetValue<string>() ?? WriterName,
      // The prompt variable name for the history argument.
      HistoryVariableName = "history",
      // Save tokens by not including the entire history in the prompt
      HistoryReducer = new ChatHistoryTruncationReducer(3),
  };   

// Create a chat using the defined selection strategy.
AgentGroupChat chat =
    new(writerAgent, reviewerAgent)
    {
        ExecutionSettings = new() { SelectionStrategy = selectionStrategy }
    };

### Chat Termination

In _multi-turn_ invocation, the _Termination Strategy_ dictates when the final turn takes place. This strategy ensures the conversation ends at the appropriate point.

This strategy is defined by a base class that can be extended to implement custom behaviors tailored to specific needs. For convenience, serveral predefined concrete _Selection Strategies_ are also available, offering ready-to-use approaches for defining termination criteria for an _Agent Chat_ conversations.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

.NET Selection Strategy API:
- [`TerminationStrategy`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.agents.chat.terminationstrategy)
- [`RegexTerminationStrategy`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.agents.chat.regexterminationstrategy)
- [`KernelFunctionSelectionStrategy`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.agents.chat.kernelfunctionselectionstrategy)
- [`KernelFunctionTerminationStrategy`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.agents.chat.kernelfunctionterminationstrategy)
- [`AggregatorTerminationStrategy`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.agents.chat.aggregatorterminationstrategy)
- [`Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Agents.History`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.agents.history)

```csharp
// Initialize a Kernel with a chat-completion service
Kernel kernel = ...;

// Create the agents
ChatCompletionAgent writerAgent =
    new()
    {
        Name = "Writer",
        Instructions = "<writer instructions>",
        Kernel = kernel
    };

ChatCompletionAgent reviewerAgent =
    new()
    {
        Name = "Reviewer",
        Instructions = "<reviewer instructions>",
        Kernel = kernel
    };

// Define a kernel function for the selection strategy
KernelFunction terminationFunction =
    AgentGroupChat.CreatePromptFunctionForStrategy(
        $$$"""
        Determine if the reviewer has approved.  If so, respond with a single word: yes

        History:

        """,

// Define the termination strategy
KernelFunctionTerminationStrategy terminationStrategy = 
  new(selectionFunction, kernel)
  {
      // Only the reviewer may give approval.
      Agents = [reviewerAgent],
      // Parse the function response.
      ResultParser = (result) => 
        result.GetValue<string>()?.Contains("yes", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) ?? false,
      // The prompt variable name for the history argument.
      HistoryVariableName = "history",
      // Save tokens by not including the entire history in the prompt
      HistoryReducer = new ChatHistoryTruncationReducer(1),
      // Limit total number of turns no matter what
      MaximumIterations = 10,
};

// Create a chat using the defined termination strategy.
AgentGroupChat chat =
    new(writerAgent, reviewerAgent)
    {
        ExecutionSettings = new() { TerminationStrategy = terminationStrategy }
    };

### Resetting Chat Completion State

Regardless of whether _Agent Group Chat_ is invoked using the single-turn or multi-turn approach, the state of the _Agent Group Chat_ is updated to indicate it is _completed_ once the termination criteria is met. This ensures that the system recognizes when a conversation has fully concluded. To continue using an _Agent Group Chat_ instance after it has reached the _Completed_ state, this state must be reset to allow further interactions. Without resetting, additional interactions or agent responses will not be possible.

In the case of a multi-turn invocation that reaches the maximum turn limit, the system will cease agent invocation but will not mark the instance as _completed_. This allows for the possibility of extending the conversation without needing to reset the _Completion_ state.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
```csharp
// Define an use chat
AgentGroupChat chat = ...;

// Evaluate if completion is met and reset.
if (chat.IsComplete) 
{
  // Opt to take action on the chat result...

  // Reset completion state to continue use
  chat.IsComplete = false;
}
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
```python
# Define a group chat
chat = AgentGroupChat()

# Evaluate if completion is met and reset
if chat.is_complete:
    # Reset completion state to continue use
    chat.is_complete = False
```

::: zone-end


### Clear Full Conversation State

When done using an _Agent Chat_ where an [_Open AI Assistant_](./assistant-agent.md) participated, it may be necessary to delete the remote _thread_ associated with the _assistant_. _Agent Chat_ supports resetting or clearing the entire conversation state, which includes deleting any remote _thread_ definition. This ensures that no residual conversation data remains linked to the assistant once the chat concludes.

A full reset does not remove the _agents_ that had joined the _Agent Chat_ and leaves the _Agent Chat_ in a state where it can be reused. This allows for the continuation of interactions with the same agents without needing to reinitialize them, making future conversations more efficient.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
```csharp
// Define an use chat
AgentGroupChat chat = ...;

// Clear the all conversation state
await chat.ResetAsync();
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
```python
# Define a group chat
chat = AgentGroupChat()

# Clear the conversation state
await chat.reset()
```
