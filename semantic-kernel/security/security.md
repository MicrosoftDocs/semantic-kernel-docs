# Security

When building out your AI solutions using Semantic Kernel there are key security measures to keep in mind:

-	Anticipate Misuse from users and have safeguards in place.
-	Ensure there are safeguards on the AI you’re creating to limit hallucinations
-	Limit Permissions – ensure individuals have JIT access for items they need and aren’t over permissioned when developing
-	Microsoft follows the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure principles: microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/cvd?rtc=2
-	Report Security Issues: Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.
-	Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report.
-	If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to secure@microsoft.com. If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page.
-	You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at microsoft.com/msrc.
-	Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:
-	Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
-	Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
-	The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
-	Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
-	Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
-	Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
-	Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
-	This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
