# Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows Orchestrations - Handoff

Handoff orchestration allows agents to transfer control to one another based on the context or user request. Each agent can "handoff" the conversation to another agent with the appropriate expertise, ensuring that the right agent handles each part of the task. This is particularly useful in customer support, expert systems, or any scenario requiring dynamic delegation.

## Differences Between Handoff and Agent-as-Tools

While agent-as-tools is commonly considered as a multi-agent pattern and it may look similar to handoff at first glance, there are fundamental differences between the two:

- **Control Flow**: In handoff orchestration, control is explicitly passed between agents based on defined rules. Each agent can decide to hand off the entire task to another agent. There is no central authority managing the workflow. In contrast, agent-as-tools involves a primary agent that delegates sub tasks to other agents and once the agent completes the sub task, control returns to the primary agent.
- **Task Ownership**: In handoff, the agent receiving the handoff takes full ownership of the task. In agent-as-tools, the primary agent retains overall responsibility for the task, while other agents are treated as tools to assist in specific subtasks.
- **Context Management**: In handoff orchestration, the conversation is handed off to another agent entirely. The receiving agent has full context of what has been done so far. In agent-as-tools, the primary agent manages the overall context and may provide only relevant information to the tool agents as needed.
