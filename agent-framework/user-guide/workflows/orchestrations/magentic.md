# Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows Orchestrations: Magentic

Magentic orchestration is designed based on the [Magentic-One](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/magentic-one.html) system invented by AutoGen. It is a flexible, general-purpose multi-agent pattern designed for complex, open-ended tasks that require dynamic collaboration. In this pattern, a dedicated Magentic manager coordinates a team of specialized agents, selecting which agent should act next based on the evolving context, task progress, and agent capabilities.

The Magentic manager maintains a shared context, tracks progress, and adapts the workflow in real time. This enables the system to break down complex problems, delegate subtasks, and iteratively refine solutions through agent collaboration. The orchestration is especially well-suited for scenarios where the solution path is not known in advance and may require multiple rounds of reasoning, research, and computation.
