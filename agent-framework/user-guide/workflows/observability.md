# Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows - Observability

Observability provides insights into the internal state and behavior of workflows during execution. This includes logging, metrics, and tracing capabilities that help monitor and debug workflows.

> [!TIP]
> Observability is a framework-wide feature and is not limited to workflows. For more information, refer to [Agent Observability](../agents/agent-observability.md).

Aside from the standard [GenAI telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/), Agent Framework Workflows emits additional spans, logs, and metrics to provide deeper insights into workflow execution. These observability features help developers understand the flow of messages, the performance of executors, and any errors that may occur.

## Workflow Spans

| Span Name                        | Description                                      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `workflow.build`                 | For each workflow build                          |
| `workflow.run`                   | For each workflow execution                      |
| `message.send`                   | For each message sent to an executor             |
| `executor.process`               | For each executor processing a message           |
| `edge_group.process`             | For each edge group processing a message         |

### Links between Spans

When an executor sends a message to another executor, the `message.send` span is created as a child of the `executor.process` span. However, the `executor.process` span of the target executor will not be a child of the `message.send` span because the execution is not nested. Instead, the `executor.process` span of the target executor is linked to the `message.send` span of the source executor. This creates a traceable path through the workflow execution.
