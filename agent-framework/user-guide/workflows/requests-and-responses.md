# Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows - Request and Response

This page provides an overview of how **Request and Response** handling works in the Microsoft Agent Framework Workflow system.

## Overview

Executors in a workflow can send requests to outside of the workflow and wait for responses. This is useful for scenarios where an executor needs to interact with external systems, such as human-in-the-loop interactions, or any other asynchronous operations.

## Enable Request and Response Handling in a Workflow

Requests and responses are handled via a special type called `InputPort`.

```csharp
// Create an input port that receives requests of type CustomRequestType and responses of type CustomResponseType.
var inputPort = InputPort.Create<CustomRequestType, CustomResponseType>("input-port");
```

Add the input port to a workflow.

```csharp
var executorA = new SomeExecutor();
var workflow = new WorkflowBuilder(inputPort)
    .AddEdge(inputPort, executorA)
    .AddEdge(executorA, inputPort)
    .Build<CustomRequestType>();
```

Now, because in the workflow we have `executorA` connected to the `inputPort` in both directions, `executorA` needs to be able to send requests and receive responses via the `inputPort`. Here is what we need to do in `SomeExecutor` to send a request and receive a response.

```csharp
internal sealed class SomeExecutor() : Executor<CustomResponseType>("SomeExecutor")
{
    public async ValueTask HandleAsync(CustomResponseType message, IWorkflowContext context)
    {
        // Process the response...
        ...
        // Send a request
        await context.SendMessageAsync(new CustomRequestType(...)).ConfigureAwait(false);
    }
}
```

Alternatively, `SomeExecutor` can separate the request sending and response handling into two handlers.

```csharp
internal sealed class SomeExecutor() : Executor("SomeExecutor")
{
    protected override RouteBuilder ConfigureRoutes(RouteBuilder routeBuilder)
    {
        return routeBuilder
            .AddHandler<CustomResponseType>(this.HandleCustomResponseAsync)
            .AddHandler<OtherDataType>(this.HandleOtherDataAsync);
    }

    public async ValueTask HandleCustomResponseAsync(CustomResponseType message, IWorkflowContext context)
    {
        // Process the response...
        ...
    }

    public async ValueTask HandleOtherDataAsync(OtherDataType message, IWorkflowContext context)
    {
        // Process the message...
        ...
        // Send a request
        await context.SendMessageAsync(new CustomRequestType(...)).ConfigureAwait(false);
    }
}

```

Executors can send requests using `ctx.request_info()` and handle responses with `@response_handler`.

```python
from agent_framework import response_handler, WorkflowBuilder

executor_a = SomeExecutor()
executor_b = SomeOtherExecutor()
workflow_builder = WorkflowBuilder()
workflow_builder.set_start_executor(executor_a)
workflow_builder.add_edge(executor_a, executor_b)
workflow = workflow_builder.build()
```

`executor_a` can send requests and receive responses directly using built-in capabilities.

```python
from agent_framework import (
    Executor,
    WorkflowContext,
    handler,
    response_handler,
)

class SomeExecutor(Executor):

    @handler
    async def handle_data(
        self,
        data: OtherDataType,
        context: WorkflowContext,
    ):
        # Process the message...
        ...
        # Send a request using the API
        await context.request_info(
            request_data=CustomRequestType(...),
            response_type=CustomResponseType
        )

    @response_handler
    async def handle_response(
        self,
        original_request: CustomRequestType,
        response: CustomResponseType,
        context: WorkflowContext,
    ):
        # Process the response...
        ...
```

The `@response_handler` decorator automatically registers the method to handle responses for the specified request and response types.

## Handling Requests and Responses

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

An `InputPort` emits a `RequestInfoEvent` when it receives a request. You can subscribe to these events to handle incoming requests from the workflow. When you receive a response from an external system, send it back to the workflow using the response mechanism. The framework automatically routes the response to the executor that sent the original request.

```csharp
StreamingRun handle = await InProcessExecution.StreamAsync(workflow, input).ConfigureAwait(false);
await foreach (WorkflowEvent evt in handle.WatchStreamAsync().ConfigureAwait(false))
{
    switch (evt)
    {
        case RequestInfoEvent requestInputEvt:
            // Handle `RequestInfoEvent` from the workflow
            ExternalResponse response = requestInputEvt.Request.CreateResponse<CustomResponseType>(...);
            await handle.SendResponseAsync(response).ConfigureAwait(false);
            break;

        case WorkflowOutputEvent workflowOutputEvt:
            // The workflow has completed successfully
            Console.WriteLine($"Workflow completed with result: {workflowOutputEvt.Data}");
            return;
    }
}
```

Executors can send requests directly without needing a separate component. When an executor calls `ctx.request_info()`, the workflow emits a `RequestInfoEvent`. You can subscribe to these events to handle incoming requests from the workflow. When you receive a response from an external system, send it back to the workflow using the response mechanism. The framework automatically routes the response to the executor's `@response_handler` method.

```python
from agent_framework import RequestInfoEvent

while True:
    request_info_events : list[RequestInfoEvent] = []
    pending_responses : dict[str, CustomResponseType] = {}

    stream = workflow.run_stream(input) if not pending_responses else workflow.send_responses_streaming(pending_responses)

    async for event in stream:
        if isinstance(event, RequestInfoEvent):
            # Handle `RequestInfoEvent` from the workflow
            request_info_events.append(event)

    if not request_info_events:
        break

    for request_info_event in request_info_events:
        # Handle `RequestInfoEvent` from the workflow
        response = CustomResponseType(...)
        pending_responses[request_info_event.request_id] = response
```

## Checkpoints and Requests

To learn more about checkpoints, please refer to this [page](./checkpoints.md).

When a checkpoint is created, pending requests are also saved as part of the checkpoint state. When you restore from a checkpoint, any pending requests will be re-emitted as `RequestInfoEvent` objects, allowing you to capture and respond to them. You cannot provide responses directly during the resume operation - instead, you must listen for the re-emitted events and respond using the standard response mechanism.
