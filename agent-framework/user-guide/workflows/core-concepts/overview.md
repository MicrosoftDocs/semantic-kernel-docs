# Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows Core Concepts

This page provides an overview of the core concepts and architecture of the Microsoft Agent Framework Workflow system. It covers the fundamental building blocks, execution model, and key features that enable developers to create robust, type-safe workflows.

## Core Components

The workflow framework consists of four core layers that work together to create a flexible, type-safe execution environment:

- [**Executors**](executors.md) and [**Edges**](edges.md) form a directed graph representing the workflow structure
- [**Workflows**](workflows.md) orchestrate executor execution, message routing, and event streaming
- [**Events**](events.md) provide observability into the workflow execution

## Next Steps

To dive deeper into each core component, explore the following sections:

- [Executors](executors.md)
- [Edges](edges.md)
- [Workflows](workflows.md)
- [Events](events.md)
