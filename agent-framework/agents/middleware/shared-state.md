# Shared State

Shared state allows middleware components to communicate and share data during the processing of an agent request. This is useful for passing information between middleware in the chain, such as timing data, request IDs, or accumulated metrics.

:::zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

In C#, middleware can use a shared `AgentRunOptions` or custom context objects to pass state between middleware components. You can also use the `Use(sharedFunc: ...)` overload for input-only inspection middleware.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Azure.AI.Projects;
using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;

// Shared state container that middleware instances can reference
var sharedState = new Dictionary<string, object> { ["callCount"] = 0 };

// Middleware that increments a shared call counter
async Task<AgentResponse> CounterMiddleware(
    IEnumerable<ChatMessage> messages,
    AgentSession? session,
    AgentRunOptions? options,
    AIAgent innerAgent,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var count = (int)sharedState["callCount"] + 1;
    sharedState["callCount"] = count;
    Console.WriteLine($"[Counter] Call #{count}");

    return await innerAgent.RunAsync(messages, session, options, cancellationToken);
}

// Middleware that reads shared state to enrich output
async Task<AgentResponse> EnrichMiddleware(
    IEnumerable<ChatMessage> messages,
    AgentSession? session,
    AgentRunOptions? options,
    AIAgent innerAgent,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var response = await innerAgent.RunAsync(messages, session, options, cancellationToken);
    var count = (int)sharedState["callCount"];
    Console.WriteLine($"[Enrich] Total calls so far: {count}");
    return response;
}

AIAgent agent = new AIProjectClient(
    new Uri("<your-foundry-project-endpoint>"),
    new DefaultAzureCredential())
        .AsAIAgent(
            model: "gpt-4o-mini",
            instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.");

var agentWithState = agent
    .AsBuilder()
        .Use(runFunc: CounterMiddleware, runStreamingFunc: null)
        .Use(runFunc: EnrichMiddleware, runStreamingFunc: null)
    .Build();

Console.WriteLine(await agentWithState.RunAsync("What's the weather in New York?"));
Console.WriteLine(await agentWithState.RunAsync("What time is it in London?"));
Console.WriteLine($"Total calls: {sharedState["callCount"]}");
```

> [!WARNING]
> `DefaultAzureCredential` is convenient for development but requires careful consideration in production. In production, consider using a specific credential (e.g., `ManagedIdentityCredential`) to avoid latency issues, unintended credential probing, and potential security risks from fallback mechanisms.

### Middleware container with shared state

The following example shows how to use a middleware container to share state across middleware components:

```python
# Copyright (c) Microsoft. All rights reserved.

import asyncio
from collections.abc import Awaitable, Callable
from random import randint
from typing import Annotated

from agent_framework import (
    FunctionInvocationContext,
    tool,
)
from agent_framework import Agent
from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient
from azure.identity.aio import AzureCliCredential
from pydantic import Field

"""
Shared State Function-based MiddlewareTypes Example

This sample demonstrates how to implement function-based middleware within a class to share state.
The example includes:

- A MiddlewareContainer class with two simple function middleware methods
- First middleware: Counts function calls and stores the count in shared state
- Second middleware: Uses the shared count to add call numbers to function results

This approach shows how middleware can work together by sharing state within the same class instance.
