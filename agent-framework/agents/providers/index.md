# Providers Overview

Microsoft Agent Framework supports several types of agents to accommodate different use cases and requirements. All agents are derived from a common base class, `AIAgent`, which provides a consistent interface for all agent types.

## Simple agents based on inference services

Agent Framework makes it easy to create simple agents based on many different inference services. Any inference service that provides a `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatClient` implementation can be used to build these agents.

The following providers are available for .NET:

- **[Azure OpenAI](./azure-openai.md)** — Full-featured provider with chat completion, responses API, and tool support.
- **[OpenAI](./openai.md)** — Direct OpenAI API access with chat completion and responses API.
- **[Foundry](./azure-ai-foundry.md)** — Persistent server-side agents with managed chat history.
- **[Anthropic](./anthropic.md)** — Claude models with function tools and streaming support.
- **[Ollama](./ollama.md)** — Run open-source models locally.
- **[GitHub Copilot](./github-copilot.md)** — GitHub Copilot SDK integration with shell and file access.
- **[Copilot Studio](./copilot-studio.md)** — Integration with Microsoft Copilot Studio agents.
- **[Custom](./custom.md)** — Build your own provider by implementing the `AIAgent` base class.
