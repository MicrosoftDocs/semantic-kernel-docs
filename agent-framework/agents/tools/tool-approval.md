# Using function tools with human in the loop approvals

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

This tutorial step shows you how to use function tools that require human approval with an agent, where the agent is built on the Azure OpenAI Chat Completion service.

When agents require any user input, for example to approve a function call, this is referred to as a human-in-the-loop pattern.
An agent run that requires user input, will complete with a response that indicates what input is required from the user, instead of completing with a final answer.
The caller of the agent is then responsible for getting the required input from the user, and passing it back to the agent as part of a new agent run.

## Prerequisites

For prerequisites and installing NuGet packages, see the [Create and run a simple agent](../../concepts/agents/running-agents.md) step in this tutorial.

## Create the agent with function tools

When using functions, it's possible to indicate for each function, whether it requires human approval before being executed.
This is done by wrapping the `AIFunction` instance in an `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction` instance.

Here is an example of a simple function tool that fakes getting the weather for a given location.

```csharp
using System;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Linq;
using Azure.AI.Projects;
using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;

[Description("Get the weather for a given location.")]
static string GetWeather([Description("The location to get the weather for.")] string location)
    => $"The weather in {location} is cloudy with a high of 15°C.";
```

To create an `AIFunction` and then wrap it in an `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction`, you can do the following:

```csharp
AIFunction weatherFunction = AIFunctionFactory.Create(GetWeather);
AIFunction approvalRequiredWeatherFunction = new ApprovalRequiredAIFunction(weatherFunction);
```

When creating the agent, you can now provide the approval requiring function tool to the agent, by passing a list of tools to the `AsAIAgent` method.

```csharp
AIAgent agent = new AIProjectClient(
    new Uri("<your-foundry-project-endpoint>"),
    new DefaultAzureCredential())
     .AsAIAgent(
        model: "gpt-4o-mini",
        instructions: "You are a helpful assistant",
        tools: [approvalRequiredWeatherFunction]);
```

> [!WARNING]
> `DefaultAzureCredential` is convenient for development but requires careful consideration in production. In production, consider using a specific credential (e.g., `ManagedIdentityCredential`) to avoid latency issues, unintended credential probing, and potential security risks from fallback mechanisms.

Since you now have a function that requires approval, the agent might respond
with a request for approval instead of executing the function directly and
returning the result.
You can check the response content for any `ToolApprovalRequestContent`
instances, which indicates that the agent requires user approval for a function.

```csharp
AgentSession session = await agent.CreateSessionAsync();
AgentResponse response = await agent.RunAsync("What is the weather like in Amsterdam?", session);

var toolApprovalRequests = response.Messages
    .SelectMany(x => x.Contents)
    .OfType<ToolApprovalRequestContent>()
    .ToList();
```

If there are any function approval requests, the function call including its
name and arguments is available from the `ToolCall` property on the
`ToolApprovalRequestContent` instance.
This can be shown to the user, so that they can decide whether to approve or reject the function call.
For this example, assume there is one request.

```csharp
ToolApprovalRequestContent requestContent = toolApprovalRequests.First();
var functionCall = (FunctionCallContent)requestContent.ToolCall;
Console.WriteLine($"We require approval to execute '{functionCall.Name}'");
```

Once the user has provided their input, use the `CreateResponse` method on
`ToolApprovalRequestContent` to create the approval response.
Pass `true` to approve the function call, or `false` to reject it.

The response content can then be passed to the agent in a new `User` `ChatMessage`, along with the same session object to get the result back from the agent.

```csharp
var approvalMessage = new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, [requestContent.CreateResponse(true)]);
Console.WriteLine(await agent.RunAsync(approvalMessage, session));
```

Whenever you are using function tools with human in the loop approvals,
remember to check for `ToolApprovalRequestContent` instances in the response,
after each agent run, until all function calls have been approved or rejected.

> [!TIP]
> See the [.NET Agents Step 01: Using Function Tools with Approvals](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/dotnet/samples/02-agents/Agents/Agent_Step01_UsingFunctionToolsWithApprovals) sample for a complete, runnable example.

This tutorial step shows you how to use function tools that require human approval with an agent.

When agents require any user input, for example to approve a function call, this is referred to as a human-in-the-loop pattern.
An agent run that requires user input, will complete with a response that indicates what input is required from the user, instead of completing with a final answer.
The caller of the agent is then responsible for getting the required input from the user, and passing it back to the agent as part of a new agent run.

## Prerequisites

For prerequisites and installing Python packages, see the [Create and run a simple agent](../../concepts/agents/running-agents.md) step in this tutorial.

## Create the agent with function tools requiring approval

When using functions, it's possible to indicate for each function, whether it requires human approval before being executed.
This is done by setting the `approval_mode` parameter to `"always_require"` when using the `@tool` decorator.

Here is an example of a simple function tool that fakes getting the weather for a given location.

```python
from typing import Annotated
from agent_framework import tool

@tool
def get_weather(location: Annotated[str, "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"]) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a given location."""
    return f"The weather in {location} is cloudy with a high of 15°C."
```

To create a function that requires approval, you can use the `approval_mode` parameter:

```python
@tool(approval_mode="always_require")
def get_weather_detail(location: Annotated[str, "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"]) -> str:
    """Get detailed weather information for a given location."""
    return f"The weather in {location} is cloudy with a high of 15°C, humidity 88%."
```

When creating the agent, you can now provide the approval requiring function tool to the agent, by passing a list of tools to the `Agent` constructor.

```python
from agent_framework import Agent
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient

async with Agent(
    client=OpenAIChatClient(),
    name="WeatherAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful weather assistant.",
    tools=[get_weather, get_weather_detail],
) as agent:
    # Agent is ready to use
    pass
```

Since you now have a function that requires approval, the agent might respond with a request for approval instead of executing the function directly and returning the result.
You can check the response for any user input requests, which indicates that the agent requires user approval for a function.

```python
result = await agent.run("What is the detailed weather like in Amsterdam?")

if result.user_input_requests:
    for user_input_needed in result.user_input_requests:
        if user_input_needed.function_call is None:
            continue
        print(f"Function: {user_input_needed.function_call.name}")
        print(f"Arguments: {user_input_needed.function_call.arguments}")
```

If there are any function approval requests, the detail of the function call including name and arguments can be found in the `function_call` property on the user input request.
This can be shown to the user, so that they can decide whether to approve or reject the function call.

Once the user has provided their input, you can create a response using the `to_function_approval_response` method on the user input request.
Pass `True` to approve the function call, or `False` to reject it.

The response can then be passed to the agent in a new `Message`, to get the result back from the agent.

```python
from agent_framework import Message

# Get user approval (in a real application, this would be interactive)
user_approval = True  # or False to reject

# Create the approval response
approval_message = Message(
    role="user",
    contents=[user_input_needed.to_function_approval_response(user_approval)]
)

# Continue the conversation with the approval
final_result = await agent.run([
    "What is the detailed weather like in Amsterdam?",
    Message(role="assistant", contents=[user_input_needed]),
    approval_message
])
print(final_result.text)
```

## Handling approvals in a loop

When working with multiple function calls that require approval, you may need to handle approvals in a loop until all functions are approved or rejected:

```python
async def handle_approvals(query: str, agent) -> str:
    """Handle function call approvals in a loop."""
    current_input = query

    while True:
        result = await agent.run(current_input)

        if not result.user_input_requests:
            # No more approvals needed, return the final result
            return result.text

        # Build new input with all context
        new_inputs = [query]

        for user_input_needed in result.user_input_requests:
            if user_input_needed.function_call is None:
                continue
            print(f"Approval needed for: {user_input_needed.function_call.name}")
            print(f"Arguments: {user_input_needed.function_call.arguments}")

            # Add the assistant message with the approval request
            new_inputs.append(Message(role="assistant", contents=[user_input_needed]))

            # Get user approval (in practice, this would be interactive)
            user_approval = True  # Replace with actual user input

            # Add the user's approval response
            new_inputs.append(
                Message(role="user", contents=[user_input_needed.to_function_approval_response(user_approval)])
            )

        # Continue with all the context
        current_input = new_inputs

# Usage
result_text = await handle_approvals("Get detailed weather for Seattle and Portland", agent)
print(result_text)
```

Whenever you are using function tools with human in the loop approvals, remember to check for user input requests in the response, after each agent run, until all function calls have been approved or rejected.

## Tool approval

You can require human approval before a tool is executed by wrapping it with `tool.ApprovalRequiredFunc`:

```go
import "github.com/microsoft/agent-framework-go/tool"

approvedWeatherTool := tool.ApprovalRequiredFunc(weatherTool)

a := foundryprovider.NewAgent(endpoint, token, foundryprovider.ModelDeployment(model), foundryprovider.AgentConfig{
    Instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    Config: agent.Config{
        Tools: []tool.Tool{approvedWeatherTool},
    },
})
```

When the model requests a tool call, the framework intercepts it and waits for approval before executing. The approval flow is handled through middleware.

::: zone-end

<a id="use-tool-approval-with-harnessed-agent"></a>

## Use tool approval with Harnessed Agent

Plain/manual composition requires an approval-marked tool and an
approval-response loop. A harnessed agent uses the same approval-marked tools
and response content, but also installs middleware for queued requests, standing
"always approve" rules, and optional heuristic auto-approval.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

Wrap functions that require approval in `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction`, then add
them through `HarnessAgentOptions.ChatOptions.Tools`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;

var weatherTool = new ApprovalRequiredAIFunction(
    AIFunctionFactory.Create(GetWeather));

AIAgent agent = chatClient.AsHarnessAgent(new HarnessAgentOptions
{
    ChatOptions = new ChatOptions
    {
        Instructions = "You are a helpful assistant.",
        Tools = [weatherTool],
    },
});

AgentSession session = await agent.CreateSessionAsync();
AgentResponse response = await agent.RunAsync(
    "What is the weather like in Amsterdam?",
    session);
```

`DisableToolAutoApproval` defaults to `false`, so the harness adds
`ToolApprovalAgent`. With the default `ToolApprovalAgentOptions`, no heuristic
rules are configured; unmatched `ToolApprovalRequestContent` items still return
to the caller for approval. To add trusted auto-approval callbacks, set
`ToolApprovalAgentOptions.AutoApprovalRules`.

Setting `DisableToolAutoApproval = true` removes only the standing-rule, queuing,
and heuristic auto-approval middleware. It doesn't remove the approval
requirement from an `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction`. Approval-response binding and
bypassing of tools that don't require approval also remain enabled by default;
their separate opt-outs are `DisableApprovalResponseBinding` and
`DisableApprovalNotRequiredFunctionBypassing`.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"

Mark the tool with `approval_mode="always_require"` and pass it to `create_harness_agent`:

```python
from agent_framework import create_harness_agent, tool

@tool(approval_mode="always_require")
def get_weather_detail(location: str) -> str:
    """Get detailed weather information for a location."""
    return f"The weather in {location} is cloudy with a high of 15°C."

agent = create_harness_agent(
    client=client,
    agent_instructions="You are a helpful weather assistant.",
    tools=get_weather_detail,
)

session = agent.create_session()
result = await agent.run(
    "What is the detailed weather like in Amsterdam?",
    session=session,
)
```

`disable_tool_auto_approval=False` adds `ToolApprovalMiddleware` by default. The
middleware requires the same `AgentSession` across approval round-trips, queues
multiple requests, applies standing approvals from earlier user responses, and
evaluates `auto_approval_rules` before returning a request to the caller. With
`auto_approval_rules=None`, no heuristic callback auto-approves a call.

Setting `disable_tool_auto_approval=True` removes that harness middleware, but
it doesn't change the tool's `approval_mode`; the normal
`result.user_input_requests` approval flow still applies.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-go"

A packaged Go harness isn't currently available. Wrap approval-required tools
with `tool.ApprovalRequiredFunc` and compose the approval middleware directly.
