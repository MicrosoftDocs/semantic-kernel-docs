# Using MCP tools with Foundry Agents

You can extend the capabilities of your Microsoft Foundry agent by connecting it to tools hosted on remote [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/model-context-protocol) servers (bring your own MCP server endpoint).

## How to use the Model Context Protocol tool

This section explains how to create a Microsoft Foundry-backed Python agent with a hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration. The agent can utilize MCP tools that are managed and executed by the Foundry service, allowing for secure and controlled access to external resources.

### Key Features

- **Hosted MCP Server**: The MCP server is hosted and managed by Foundry, eliminating the need to manage server infrastructure
- **Persistent Agents**: Agents are created and stored server-side, allowing for stateful conversations
- **Tool Approval Workflow**: Configurable approval mechanisms for MCP tool invocations

### How It Works

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

#### 1. Environment Setup

The sample requires two environment variables:
- `AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`: Your Foundry project endpoint URL
- `AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_MODEL_ID`: The model deployment name (defaults to "gpt-4.1-mini")

```csharp
var endpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT")
    ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT is not set.");
var model = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_MODEL_ID") ?? "gpt-4.1-mini";
```

#### 2. Agent Configuration

The agent is configured with specific instructions and metadata:

```csharp
const string AgentName = "MicrosoftLearnAgent";
const string AgentInstructions = "You answer questions by searching the Microsoft Learn content only.";
```

This creates an agent specialized for answering questions using Microsoft Learn documentation.

#### 3. MCP Tool Definition

The sample creates an MCP tool definition that points to a hosted MCP server:

```csharp
var mcpTool = new MCPToolDefinition(
    serverLabel: "microsoft_learn",
    serverUrl: "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp");
mcpTool.AllowedTools.Add("microsoft_docs_search");
```

**Key Components:**
- **serverLabel**: A unique identifier for the MCP server instance
- **serverUrl**: The URL of the hosted MCP server
- **AllowedTools**: Specifies which tools from the MCP server the agent can use

#### 4. Agent Creation

The agent is created server-side using the Azure AI Projects SDK:

```csharp
var aiProjectClient = new AIProjectClient(new Uri(endpoint), new DefaultAzureCredential());

var agentVersion = await aiProjectClient.AgentAdministrationClient.CreateAgentVersionAsync(
    AgentName,
    new ProjectsAgentVersionCreationOptions(
        new DeclarativeAgentDefinition(model)
        {
            Instructions = AgentInstructions,
            Tools = { mcpTool }
        }));
```

> [!WARNING]
> `DefaultAzureCredential` is convenient for development but requires careful consideration in production. In production, consider using a specific credential (e.g., `ManagedIdentityCredential`) to avoid latency issues, unintended credential probing, and potential security risks from fallback mechanisms.

This creates a versioned agent that:
- Lives on the Foundry service
- Has access to the specified MCP tools
- Can maintain conversation state across multiple interactions

#### 5. Agent Retrieval and Execution

The created agent is retrieved as an `AIAgent` instance:

```csharp
AIAgent agent = aiProjectClient.AsAIAgent(agentVersion);
```

#### 6. Tool Resource Configuration

The sample configures tool resources with approval settings:

```csharp
var runOptions = new ChatClientAgentRunOptions()
{
    ChatOptions = new()
    {
        RawRepresentationFactory = (_) => new ThreadAndRunOptions()
        {
            ToolResources = new MCPToolResource(serverLabel: "microsoft_learn")
            {
                RequireApproval = new MCPApproval("never"),
            }.ToToolResources()
        }
    }
};
```

**Key Configuration:**
- **MCPToolResource**: Links the MCP server instance to the agent execution
- **RequireApproval**: Controls when user approval is needed for tool invocations
  - `"never"`: Tools execute automatically without approval
  - `"always"`: All tool invocations require user approval
  - Custom approval rules can also be configured

#### 7. Agent Execution

The agent is invoked with a question and executes using the configured MCP tools:

```csharp
AgentSession session = await agent.CreateSessionAsync();
var response = await agent.RunAsync(
    "Please summarize the Azure AI Agent documentation related to MCP Tool calling?",
    session,
    runOptions);
Console.WriteLine(response);
```

#### 8. Cleanup

The sample demonstrates proper resource cleanup:

```csharp
await aiProjectClient.AgentAdministrationClient.DeleteAgentAsync(agent.Id);
```

> [!TIP]
> See the [.NET Foundry Agent Hosted MCP Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/dotnet/samples/02-agents/ModelContextProtocol/FoundryAgent_Hosted_MCP) for a complete runnable example.

Foundry provides seamless integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through the Python Agent Framework. The service manages the MCP server hosting and execution, eliminating infrastructure management while providing secure, controlled access to external tools.

### Environment Setup

Configure your Foundry project credentials through environment variables:

```python
import os
from azure.identity.aio import AzureCliCredential
from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient

# Required environment variables
os.environ["FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT"] = "https://<your-project>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-id>"
os.environ["FOUNDRY_MODEL"] = "gpt-4o-mini"
```

### Basic MCP Integration

Create a Foundry agent with hosted MCP tools:

```python
import asyncio
from agent_framework import Agent
from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient
from azure.identity.aio import AzureCliCredential

async def basic_foundry_mcp_example():
    """Basic example of Foundry agent with hosted MCP tools."""
    async with AzureCliCredential() as credential:
        client = FoundryChatClient(credential=credential)
        # Create a hosted MCP tool using the client method
        learn_mcp = client.get_mcp_tool(
            name="Microsoft Learn MCP",
            url="https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp",
        )

        # Create agent with hosted MCP tool
        async with Agent(
            client=client,
            name="MicrosoftLearnAgent",
            instructions="You answer questions by searching Microsoft Learn content only.",
            tools=[learn_mcp],
        ) as agent:
            # Simple query without approval workflow
            result = await agent.run(
                "Please summarize the Azure AI Agent documentation related to MCP tool calling?"
            )
            print(result.text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(basic_foundry_mcp_example())
```

### Multi-Tool MCP Configuration

Use multiple hosted MCP tools with a single agent:

```python
async def multi_tool_mcp_example():
    """Example using multiple hosted MCP tools."""
    async with AzureCliCredential() as credential:
        client = FoundryChatClient(credential=credential)
        # Create multiple MCP tools using the client method
        learn_mcp = client.get_mcp_tool(
            name="Microsoft Learn MCP",
            url="https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp",
            approval_mode="never_require",  # Auto-approve documentation searches
        )
        github_mcp = client.get_mcp_tool(
            name="GitHub MCP",
            url="https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
            approval_mode="always_require",  # Require approval for GitHub operations
            headers={"Authorization": "Bearer github-token"},
        )

        # Create agent with multiple MCP tools
        async with Agent(
            client=client,
            name="MultiToolAgent",
            instructions="You can search documentation and access GitHub repositories.",
            tools=[learn_mcp, github_mcp],
        ) as agent:
            result = await agent.run(
                "Find Azure documentation and also check the latest commits in microsoft/semantic-kernel"
            )
            print(result.text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(multi_tool_mcp_example())
```

The Python Agent Framework provides seamless integration with Foundry's hosted MCP capabilities, enabling secure and scalable access to external tools while maintaining the flexibility and control needed for production applications.

MCP GitHub Integration with Personal Access Token (PAT)

This example demonstrates how to connect to GitHub's remote MCP server using a Personal Access
Token (PAT) for authentication. The agent can use GitHub operations like searching repositories,
reading files, creating issues, and more depending on how you scope your token.

Prerequisites:
1. A GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate scopes
   - Create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - For read-only operations, you can use more restrictive scopes
2. Environment variables:
   - GITHUB_PAT: Your GitHub Personal Access Token (required)
   - FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT: Your Foundry project endpoint (required)
   - FOUNDRY_MODEL: Your Foundry model deployment name (required)
"""

        print(f"Agent: {result1.text}")

        # Example 2: List my repositories
        query2 = "List all the repositories I own on GitHub"
        print(f"\nUser: {query2}")
        result2 = await agent.run(query2)
        print(f"Agent: {result2.text}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(github_mcp_example())

## Hosted MCP tools

The `hostedtool` package provides marker types for hosted tools. These tools are not executed locally — they inform the AI service that it's allowed to perform certain actions server-side.

### Hosted MCP Server

```go
import "github.com/microsoft/agent-framework-go/tool/hostedtool"

mcpTool := &hostedtool.MCPServer{
    ServerName:    "my-server",
    ServerAddress: "https://mcp.example.com",
    AllowedTools:  []string{"search", "analyze"},
}

a := openaichatagent.New(client, openaichatagent.Config{
    Model: deployment,
    Config: agent.Config{
        Tools: []tool.Tool{mcpTool},
    },
})
```

> [!NOTE]
> Hosted MCP tools require a provider that supports them, such as the OpenAI Responses API (`openairesponsesagent`).
