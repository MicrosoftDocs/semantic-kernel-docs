# The Agent Development Journey

Building AI agents is a journey. This guide takes you from understanding the fundamentals of large language models (LLMs) through progressively more powerful agent patterns, helping you understand **when** and **why** to reach for each capability.

Each step in the journey builds on the previous one, adding complexity only when the scenario demands it. Along the way, you'll learn the trade-offs of each approach so you can make informed decisions for your own applications.

| Step | What you'll learn | When you need it |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| [LLM Fundamentals](llm-fundamentals.md) | How LLMs work and what they can (and can't) do | You're new to LLMs or want to understand the foundation |
| [From LLMs to Agents](from-llms-to-agents.md) | What makes an agent more than a chat completion call, and creating your first agent with instructions | You want to understand the agent abstraction |
| [Adding Tools](adding-tools.md) | Extending agents with function tools and MCP servers | Your agent needs to interact with the real world |
| [Adding Skills](adding-skills.md) | Packaging reusable agent capabilities | You want modular, shareable agent behaviors |
| [Adding Middleware](adding-middleware.md) | Intercepting and customizing agent behavior | You need guardrails, logging, or behavioral overrides |
| [Context Providers](adding-context-providers.md) | Injecting memory and dynamic context | Your agent needs to remember or access external knowledge |
| [Agents as Tools](agents-as-tools.md) | Using one agent as a tool for another | You want agent composition |
| [Agent-to-Agent (A2A)](agent-to-agent.md) | Inter-agent communication across boundaries | Your agents need to communicate across services or organizations |
| [Workflows](workflows.md) | Orchestrating multi-agent, multi-step processes | You need explicit control over complex, multi-step execution |

## How to use this guide

- **New to AI agents?** Start from the beginning and work through each step.
- **Experienced developer?** Jump to the step that matches your current challenge.
- **Evaluating Agent Framework?** Read the "When to use" and "Trade-offs" sections on each page to understand the design space.

> [!TIP]
> Each page includes a **"When to use this"** section and a **"Trade-offs"** table to help you decide if that pattern fits your scenario.
