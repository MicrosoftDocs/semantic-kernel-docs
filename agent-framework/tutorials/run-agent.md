# Create and run a simple agent

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

This tutorial shows you how to create and run a simple agent, based on the Azure OpenAI Chat Completion service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The agent framework supports many different types of agents. This tutorial uses an agent based on a Chat Completion service, but all other agent types are run in the same way. See the [Agent Framework user guide](../user-guide/index.md) for more information on other agent types and how to construct them.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Azure OpenAI service endpoint and deployment configured](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/create-resource)
- [Azure CLI installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [authenticated (for Azure credential authentication)](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli)
- [User has the `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` or `Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor` roles, depending on need, for the Azure OpenAI resource.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For this tutorial we are using Azure OpenAI for the Chat Completion service, but you can use any inference service that is compatible with [Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatClient](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.ai.ichatclient).

## Installing Nuget packages

To use the AgentFramework with Azure OpenAI, you need to install the following NuGet packages:

```powershell
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI
dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.OpenAI
```

## Creating the agent

- First we create create a client for Azure OpenAI, by providing the Azure OpenAI endpoint and using the same login as was used when authenticating with the Azure CLI in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) step.
- Then we get a chat client for communicating with the chat completion service, where we also specify the specific model deployment to use. Use one of the deployments that you created in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) step.
- Finally we create the agent, providing instructions and a name for the agent.

```csharp
using System;
using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;
using OpenAI;

AIAgent agent = new AzureOpenAIClient(
    new Uri("https://<myresource>.openai.azure.com"),
    new AzureCliCredential())
     .GetChatClient("gpt-4o-mini")
     .CreateAIAgent(instructions: "You are good at telling jokes.", name: "Joker");
```

## Running the agent

To run the agent, call the `RunAsync` method on the agent instance, providing the user input.
The agent will return a response object, and calling `.ToString()` or `.Text` on this response object, provides the text result from the agent.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(await agent.RunAsync("Tell me a joke about a pirate."));
```

## Running the agent with streaming

To run the agent with streaming, call the `RunStreamingAsync` method on the agent instance, providing the user input.
The agent will stream a list of update objects, and calling `.ToString()` or `.Text` on each update object provides the part of the text result contained in that update.

```csharp
await foreach (var update in agent.RunStreamingAsync("Tell me a joke about a pirate."))
{
    Console.WriteLine(update);
}
```

## Running the agent with a ChatMessage

Instead of a simple string, you can also provide one or more `ChatMessage` objects to the `RunAsync` and `RunStreamingAsync` methods.

```csharp
ChatMessage message = new(ChatRole.User, [
    new TextContent("Tell me a joke about this image?"),
    new UriContent("https://samplesite.org/clown.jpg", "image/jpeg")
]);

Console.WriteLine(await agent.RunAsync(message));
```
