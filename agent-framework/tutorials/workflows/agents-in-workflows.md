# Agents in Workflows

This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate AI agents into workflows using Agent Framework. You'll learn to create workflows that leverage the power of specialized AI agents for content creation, review, and other collaborative tasks.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

## What You'll Build

You'll create a workflow that:

- Uses Azure Foundry Agent Service to create intelligent agents
- Implements a French translation agent that translates input to French
- Implements a Spanish translation agent that translates French to Spanish
- Implements an English translation agent that translates Spanish back to English
- Connects agents in a sequential workflow pipeline
- Streams real-time updates as agents process requests
- Demonstrates proper resource cleanup for Azure Foundry agents

## Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 or later
- Agent Framework installed via NuGet
- Azure Foundry project configured with proper environment variables
- Azure CLI authentication: `az login`

## Step 1: Import Required Dependencies

Start by importing the necessary components for Azure Foundry agents and workflows:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Azure.AI.Agents.Persistent;
using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
using Microsoft.Agents.AI.Workflows;
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;
```

## Step 2: Set Up Azure Foundry Client

Configure the Azure Foundry client with environment variables and authentication:

```csharp
public static class Program
{
    private static async Task Main()
    {
        // Set up the Azure Foundry client
        var endpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT")
            ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT is not set.");
        var model = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_MODEL_ID") ?? "gpt-4o-mini";
        var persistentAgentsClient = new PersistentAgentsClient(endpoint, new AzureCliCredential());
```

## Step 3: Create Specialized Azure Foundry Agents

Create three translation agents using the helper method:

```csharp
        // Create agents
        AIAgent frenchAgent = await GetTranslationAgentAsync("French", persistentAgentsClient, model);
        AIAgent spanishAgent = await GetTranslationAgentAsync("Spanish", persistentAgentsClient, model);
        AIAgent englishAgent = await GetTranslationAgentAsync("English", persistentAgentsClient, model);
```

## Step 4: Create Agent Factory Method

Implement a helper method to create Azure Foundry agents with specific instructions:

```csharp
    /// <summary>
    /// Creates a translation agent for the specified target language.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="targetLanguage">The target language for translation</param>
    /// <param name="persistentAgentsClient">The PersistentAgentsClient to create the agent</param>
    /// <param name="model">The model to use for the agent</param>
    /// <returns>A ChatClientAgent configured for the specified language</returns>
    private static async Task<ChatClientAgent> GetTranslationAgentAsync(
        string targetLanguage,
        PersistentAgentsClient persistentAgentsClient,
        string model)
    {
        var agentMetadata = await persistentAgentsClient.Administration.CreateAgentAsync(
            model: model,
            name: $"{targetLanguage} Translator",
            instructions: $"You are a translation assistant that translates the provided text to {targetLanguage}.");

        return await persistentAgentsClient.GetAIAgentAsync(agentMetadata.Value.Id);
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Build the Workflow

Connect the agents in a sequential workflow using the WorkflowBuilder:

```csharp
        // Build the workflow by adding executors and connecting them
        var workflow = new WorkflowBuilder(frenchAgent)
            .AddEdge(frenchAgent, spanishAgent)
            .AddEdge(spanishAgent, englishAgent)
            .Build();
```

## Step 6: Execute with Streaming

Run the workflow with streaming to observe real-time updates from both agents:

```csharp
        // Execute the workflow
        StreamingRun run = await InProcessExecution.StreamAsync(workflow, new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "Hello World!"));

        // Must send the turn token to trigger the agents.
        // The agents are wrapped as executors. When they receive messages,
        // they will cache the messages and only start processing when they receive a TurnToken.
        await run.TrySendMessageAsync(new TurnToken(emitEvents: true));
        await foreach (WorkflowEvent evt in run.WatchStreamAsync().ConfigureAwait(false))
        {
            if (evt is AgentRunUpdateEvent executorComplete)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{executorComplete.ExecutorId}: {executorComplete.Data}");
            }
        }
```

## Step 7: Resource Cleanup

Properly clean up the Azure Foundry agents after use:

```csharp
        // Cleanup the agents created for the sample.
        await persistentAgentsClient.Administration.DeleteAgentAsync(frenchAgent.Id);
        await persistentAgentsClient.Administration.DeleteAgentAsync(spanishAgent.Id);
        await persistentAgentsClient.Administration.DeleteAgentAsync(englishAgent.Id);
    }
```

## How It Works

1. **Azure Foundry Client Setup**: Uses `PersistentAgentsClient` with Azure CLI credentials for authentication
2. **Agent Creation**: Creates persistent agents on Azure Foundry with specific instructions for translation
3. **Sequential Processing**: French agent translates input first, then Spanish agent, then English agent
4. **Turn Token Pattern**: Agents cache messages and only process when they receive a `TurnToken`
5. **Streaming Updates**: `AgentRunUpdateEvent` provides real-time token updates as agents generate responses
6. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of Azure Foundry agents using the Administration API

## Key Concepts

- **Azure Foundry Agent Service**: Cloud-based AI agents with advanced reasoning capabilities
- **PersistentAgentsClient**: Client for creating and managing agents on Azure Foundry
- **AgentRunUpdateEvent**: Real-time streaming updates during agent execution
- **TurnToken**: Signal that triggers agent processing after message caching
- **Sequential Workflow**: Agents connected in a pipeline where output flows from one to the next

## Complete Implementation

For the complete working implementation of this Azure Foundry agents workflow, see the [FoundryAgent Program.cs](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/dotnet/samples/GettingStarted/Workflows/Agents/FoundryAgent/Program.cs) sample in the Agent Framework repository.

## What You'll Build

You'll create a workflow that:

- Uses Azure AI Agent Service to create intelligent agents
- Implements a Writer agent that creates content based on prompts
- Implements a Reviewer agent that provides feedback on the content
- Connects agents in a sequential workflow pipeline
- Streams real-time updates as agents process requests
- Demonstrates proper async context management for Azure AI clients

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Agent Framework installed: `pip install agent-framework-azure-ai`
- Azure AI Agent Service configured with proper environment variables
- Azure CLI authentication: `az login`

## Step 1: Import Required Dependencies

Start by importing the necessary components for Azure AI agents and workflows:

```python
import asyncio
from collections.abc import Awaitable, Callable
from contextlib import AsyncExitStack
from typing import Any

from agent_framework import AgentRunUpdateEvent, WorkflowBuilder, WorkflowOutputEvent
from agent_framework.azure import AzureAIAgentClient
from azure.identity.aio import AzureCliCredential
```

## Step 2: Create Azure AI Agent Factory

Create a helper function to manage Azure AI agent creation with proper async context handling:

```python
async def create_azure_ai_agent() -> tuple[Callable[..., Awaitable[Any]], Callable[[], Awaitable[None]]]:
    """Helper method to create an Azure AI agent factory and a close function.

    This makes sure the async context managers are properly handled.
    """
    stack = AsyncExitStack()
    cred = await stack.enter_async_context(AzureCliCredential())

    client = await stack.enter_async_context(AzureAIAgentClient(async_credential=cred))

    async def agent(**kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        return await stack.enter_async_context(client.create_agent(**kwargs))

    async def close() -> None:
        await stack.aclose()

    return agent, close
```

## Step 3: Create Specialized Azure AI Agents

Create two specialized agents for content creation and review:

```python
async def main() -> None:
    agent, close = await create_azure_ai_agent()
    try:
        # Create a Writer agent that generates content
        writer = await agent(
            name="Writer",
            instructions=(
                "You are an excellent content writer. You create new content and edit contents based on the feedback."
            ),
        )

        # Create a Reviewer agent that provides feedback
        reviewer = await agent(
            name="Reviewer",
            instructions=(
                "You are an excellent content reviewer. "
                "Provide actionable feedback to the writer about the provided content. "
                "Provide the feedback in the most concise manner possible."
            ),
        )
```

## Step 4: Build the Workflow

Connect the agents in a sequential workflow using the fluent builder:

```python
        # Build the workflow with agents as executors
        workflow = WorkflowBuilder().set_start_executor(writer).add_edge(writer, reviewer).build()
```

## Step 5: Execute with Streaming

Run the workflow with streaming to observe real-time updates from both agents:

```python
        last_executor_id: str | None = None

        events = workflow.run_stream("Create a slogan for a new electric SUV that is affordable and fun to drive.")
        async for event in events:
            if isinstance(event, AgentRunUpdateEvent):
                # Handle streaming updates from agents
                eid = event.executor_id
                if eid != last_executor_id:
                    if last_executor_id is not None:
                        print()
                    print(f"{eid}:", end=" ", flush=True)
                    last_executor_id = eid
                print(event.data, end="", flush=True)
            elif isinstance(event, WorkflowOutputEvent):
                print("\n===== Final output =====")
                print(event.data)
    finally:
        await close()
```

## Step 6: Complete Main Function

Wrap everything in the main function with proper async execution:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## How It Works

1. **Azure AI Client Setup**: Uses `AzureAIAgentClient` with Azure CLI credentials for authentication
2. **Agent Factory Pattern**: Creates a factory function that manages async context lifecycle for multiple agents
3. **Sequential Processing**: Writer agent generates content first, then passes it to the Reviewer agent
4. **Streaming Updates**: `AgentRunUpdateEvent` provides real-time token updates as agents generate responses
5. **Context Management**: Proper cleanup of Azure AI resources using `AsyncExitStack`

## Key Concepts

- **Azure AI Agent Service**: Cloud-based AI agents with advanced reasoning capabilities
- **AgentRunUpdateEvent**: Real-time streaming updates during agent execution
- **AsyncExitStack**: Proper async context management for multiple resources
- **Agent Factory Pattern**: Reusable agent creation with shared client configuration
- **Sequential Workflow**: Agents connected in a pipeline where output flows from one to the next
