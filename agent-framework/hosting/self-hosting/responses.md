Use `agent-framework-hosting-responses` to convert OpenAI Responses-shaped requests and responses at an endpoint your application owns. Your server chooses the web framework, route, authentication, authorization, request options, and session storage.

```bash
pip install --pre agent-framework agent-framework-foundry agent-framework-hosting agent-framework-hosting-responses azure-identity
```

The FastAPI sample is one implementation. The same helpers work with Django, Flask, Starlette, Azure Functions, or another framework.

## Host an agent endpoint

This sample converts the request to Agent Framework run values, applies an application-defined option allowlist, and persists the updated session under the newly created response ID.

:::code language="python" source="~/../agent-framework-code/python/samples/04-hosting/af-hosting/local_responses/app.py" range="107-179":::

`AgentState` resolves the target and loads or creates a session. Save the session after the run, or after a streaming run finishes, because the run updates it.

For the complete application, including the agent definition and request-option allowlist, see the [local Responses sample](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples/04-hosting/af-hosting/local_responses).

## Host a workflow endpoint

`WorkflowState` resolves the workflow, but your application owns checkpoint storage and the mapping from a response ID to a checkpoint. This sample restores the checkpoint selected by an authorized `previous_response_id`, then saves a cursor for the next response.

:::code language="python" source="~/../agent-framework-code/python/samples/04-hosting/af-hosting/local_responses_workflow/app.py" range="220-272":::

The sample's file-backed storage is for local development. Use durable storage when replicas can restart or scale out.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Treat `previous_response_id` and `conversation_id` as untrusted input. Authenticate and authorize the caller before using either ID to load or save a session or checkpoint.
